builder4impress
==============
A tool that builds impress.js presentations


Current usage instructions
---------

First - skip one slide back (left arrow) to get to the overview. [I currently scale the movements assuming you are there]

Hover over a slide and a control should show. Dragging the "M" letter will move the slide around, dragging "R" horizontally will rotate and dragging "S" vertically will scale.



Plans and issues [notes to self, but tips are appreciated ;)]
---------

find a way to position the controls better,
enable adding new slides,
automatically load the overview slide (create it?),
and obviously some simple content editing
